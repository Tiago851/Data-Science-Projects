"""
Recently I made a backup of all the photos on my cellphone to a folder in my computer. I noticed that
most of the files had a pattern in the name that could be filtered and sorted with a simple Python
script.

The aim was to sort the files this way: Year > Month > Day

Each photo was renamed with the day of the month it was taken. In case several photos were taken on the same day,
the script is prepared to handle it and it has instructions to add the hour of the photo (format hourminutesecond)
